## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of software development, ensuring that the final product meets business objectives and user needs.

### Importance in SDLC:
1. **Clarity of Objectives:** It helps stakeholders and developers establish a shared understanding of what the software should achieve.  
2. **Minimized Errors:** By capturing requirements early, misunderstandings and ambiguities are reduced, lowering the risk of costly changes later.  
3. **Improved Planning:** Clear requirements allow for accurate project estimation in terms of time, resources, and cost.  
4. **Better Quality:** A well-analyzed set of requirements ensures the developed software is aligned with user expectations, leading to higher
